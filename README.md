### General Info ###
# H4NGM4N is a hangman game programmed with Python programming language,
# using tkinter and ttkbootstrap to implement and design the user 
# interface.

### How to Play ###
# Choose a category of words from categoriesWindow.
# You have 6 lives(chances) to guess the letters of a word randomly
# choosen from the list of words that you specified.
# A pop-up screen will show you the result of your guessing (win or lose).
# start a new game, or close the game and try again later when you are
# feeling smarter ;)

### How The Game Works ###
# Allows users to choose one of 4 pre-defined word_lists from
# the categories page and based on the user choice, it generates
# a random word from that list to guess with pre-defined methods 
# and implementaions
